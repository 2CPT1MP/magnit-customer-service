# Magnit Customer Service
A fullstack MERN application that allows an administrator to manage info on their employees. That includes viewing all records, adjusting basic information and tweaking monthly income.

## Warning 
Please note that this repository provides the **development version** of the app. 
If you want to run it make sure you install all necessary dependencies in both the `root` and `client` directories with the command:
```
npm i
```
After the installation run the `dev` script:
```
npm run dev
```
That will start both client and server.
